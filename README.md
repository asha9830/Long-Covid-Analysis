# Long-Covid-Analysis

The term "Long Covid" refers to patients who continue to experience symptoms for weeks or even months after contracting COVID-19, despite the fact that the disease typically has a short duration. It is still unknown which patients are more likely to develop long-COVID. 

The research aims to design and develop a Machine learning model to predict whether the person is suffering from Long Covid or not, the earlier detection of Long Covid will help the medical expertise to give the proper care to the patient and to safeguard themselves from getting affected.

The main goal of Long Covid detection using machine learning is to create algorithms and models that can precisely identify and forecast if Long Covid is present in a person based on multiple data inputs. Long Covid refers to the persistent signs and symptoms that some people have even after they have recovered from the acute stage of Covid-19.
